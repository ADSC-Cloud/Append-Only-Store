This folder contains the scripts to initilize the cluster environment, designed for Ubuntu 16.04 started from a clear image.

Run the scripts in the following order:

1. generate security key and added authorized keys
2. install JDK 8 and config $JAVA_HOME
3. install and deploy hdfs
4. install zookeeper
5. install storm
6. deploy Waterwheel topology
7. deploy Waterhweel web ui

The scripts should be run on both master node and the slave nodes.

#### 1. Generate security key add authorized keys

##### 1.1 Generate key

On both master and slave nodes:

```./generate-public-key.sh```

##### 1.2 Add public key to the authorized_keys

On master node:

```./add-authorized-keys.sh ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub```

On slave nodes:

```./add-authorized-keys.sh ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub```

Copy id_rsa.pub from the master into a local file master-key.pub and run the following command to add it to the authorized keys:

```./add-authorized-keys.sh master-key.pub```

#### 2. Install JDK and set $JAVA_PATH

On both master and slave nodes:

```. ./install-jdk-8.sh```

After this step, ```java -version``` should be run correctly and ```echo $JAVA_HOME$``` should print the location of jdk

#### 3. Install and deploy HDFS

On master node:

Replace MASTER_IP with the actual ip

```./install-hdfs.sh -m master -p MASTER_IP```

On slave node:

Replace MASTER_IP with the actual ip

```./install-hdfs.sh -m slave -p MASTER_IP```

#### 4. Install and deploy Zookeeper

On master node only:

```./install-zookeeper.sh```

#### 5. Install and deploy Storm

On master node:

Replace MASTER_IP with the actual ip

```./install-storm.sh -m master -p MASTER_IP```

On slave node:

Replace MASTER_IP with the actual ip

```./install-storm.sh -m slave -p MASTER_IP```

#### 6. Deplay Waterwheel topology
On master node:

Replace MASTER_IP with the actual ip and NUMBER_OF_NODE with the actual value, e.g., 5

```./deploy-topology.sh -p MASTER_IP -n NUMBER_OF_NODE```

#### 7. Deploy Waterwheel web ui

On master node:

```./deploy-tomcat.sh```

Now you can open Waterwheel web ui via Â http://localhost:8080/waterwheel on master node.
